# The Airbnb Clone Project Backend

## Project Overview

Airbnb clone project designed to simulate a real-world booking platform. This project focuses on developing a robust backend architecture, implementing secure APIs, designing efficient database structures, and establishing CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.

The project aims to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform that mimics the core functionality of Airbnb, allowing users to list properties, make bookings, leave reviews, and process payments.


## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, writing APIs, integrating with databases, and ensuring the overall performance and scalability of the application.

### Database Administrator
Manages the database design, optimization, and maintenance, ensuring data integrity, performance, and security across the application.

### DevOps Engineer
Oversees the CI/CD pipeline setup, container orchestration, and infrastructure management, ensuring smooth deployment and operation of the application.

### Security Specialist
Implements security measures throughout the application, including API security, authentication, authorization, and data protection strategies.

### Frontend Developer
Creates the user interface and client-side functionality, consuming APIs from the backend to deliver a seamless user experience.

### QA Engineer
Ensures the quality of the application through manual and automated testing, identifying bugs and verifying that the application meets requirements.


## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development of secure and maintainable RESTful APIs and backend systems.
- **MySQL**: A robust relational database management system for storing and managing structured data related to users, properties, bookings, and more.
- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime for APIs, enabling more efficient data retrieval by allowing clients to request exactly what they need.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistency across different development and production environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: An automation tool for CI/CD workflows, automating testing and deployment processes directly from the GitHub repository.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for authentication and authorization.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache to improve performance by reducing database load.

## Database Design

### Users
- **user_id**: Unique identifier for each user
- **email**: User's email address (used for authentication)
- **password_hash**: Encrypted password
- **first_name**: User's first name
- **last_name**: User's last name

Users can create multiple property listings and make multiple bookings.

### Properties
- **property_id**: Unique identifier for each property
- **host_id**: Reference to the user_id of the property owner
- **title**: Property title/name
- **description**: Detailed description of the property
- **price_per_night**: Cost to stay per night

A property belongs to one user (host) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### Bookings
- **booking_id**: Unique identifier for each booking
- **property_id**: Reference to the property being booked
- **guest_id**: Reference to the user_id making the booking
- **check_in_date**: Start date of the booking
- **check_out_date**: End date of the booking

A booking belongs to one user (guest) and one property.

### Reviews
- **review_id**: Unique identifier for each review
- **booking_id**: Reference to the booking this review is for
- **rating**: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5 stars)
- **comment**: Text content of the review
- **created_at**: Timestamp when the review was created

A review belongs to one booking and indirectly to one property and one user.

### Payments
- **payment_id**: Unique identifier for each payment
- **booking_id**: Reference to the booking being paid for
- **amount**: Total payment amount
- **status**: Current status of the payment (pending, completed, failed, etc.)
- **payment_method**: Method used for payment

A payment belongs to one booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and role-based permissions. This feature ensures secure access to the platform and provides personalized experiences for different user types (guests, hosts, administrators).

### Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings, including details, availability, pricing, and images. This feature forms the core inventory of the platform, enabling hosts to showcase their properties to potential guests.

### Booking System
Manages the reservation process, including availability checking, reservation creation, modification, and cancellation. This system is crucial for connecting guests with properties and managing the temporal aspects of property rental.

### Review and Rating System
Enables guests to leave feedback and ratings for properties they've stayed in, helping future guests make informed decisions. This social proof mechanism builds trust in the platform and helps maintain quality standards.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure financial transactions between guests and hosts, including payment authorization, capture, and refund capabilities. This feature ensures the economic viability of the platform while protecting both parties in transactions.

### Search and Filtering
Allows users to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and other criteria. This discovery mechanism is essential for connecting guests with the right properties for their needs.

## API Security

### Authentication and Authorization
Implements JWT-based authentication to verify user identity and role-based authorization to control access to resources. This is crucial for protecting user accounts, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operations, and ensuring users can only perform actions appropriate to their role.

### Data Validation and Sanitization
Ensures all input data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and data corruption. This protects the integrity of the database and prevents malicious users from exploiting vulnerabilities in the application.

### Rate Limiting
Restricts the number of API requests a user can make within a specified timeframe to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks. This measure maintains service availability for all users and protects server resources from being overwhelmed.

### Secure Communication
Utilizes HTTPS/TLS encryption for all API communications to protect data in transit from interception or tampering. This is essential for safeguarding sensitive user information like personal details and payment data during transmission.

### Audit Logging
Maintains detailed logs of security-relevant events for monitoring, forensic analysis, and compliance purposes. This capability is vital for detecting security incidents, understanding attack patterns, and providing accountability.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying to various environments. For the StayBackend project, CI/CD pipelines are essential to:

- Automatically run tests when code is pushed to ensure quality and prevent regressions
- Enforce code style and security best practices through automated linting and scanning
- Create consistent deployment packages using Docker containers
- Enable seamless deployment to staging and production environments
- Provide fast feedback to developers about the quality of their code changes

The project will utilize GitHub Actions for workflow automation, integrating with Docker for containerization, and implementing automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to ensure robust quality assurance throughout the development lifecycle.
