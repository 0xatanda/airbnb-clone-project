# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project
 
 Welcome to the **Airbnb Clone Project** — a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb’s property listing and booking platform. This project will help us build modern frontend UI components, implement essential features, and follow best practices for collaboration and scalability.
 
 ## 🎯 Project Goals
 
 - Replicate key functionality of Airbnb such as:
   - Property listing view
   - Property detailed view
   - Simple checkout flow
 - Practice UI/UX design principles and component-based development
 - Simulate a real-world team environment with defined roles and responsibilities
 - Build a responsive, user-friendly interface using modern tools and frameworks
 
 ## ⚙️ Tech Stack
 
 | Layer         | Technology Used        |
 |--------------|------------------------|
 | Frontend     | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (optional) |

 ## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning
 
 A well-thought-out UI/UX design is crucial for any booking system. A clean, intuitive interface ensures users can easily browse listings, view details, and complete bookings without friction.
 
 ### ✅ Design Goals
 
 - Create a responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
 - Ensure visual consistency through reusable components
 - Prioritize accessibility and usability
 - Implement a clear navigation structure
 
 ### 🧭 Key Features to Implement
 
 | Feature                    | Description |
 |---------------------------|-------------|
 | Property Listing View     | Display multiple properties in a grid/list format |
 | Listing Detailed View     | Show more information about a selected property |
 | Simple Checkout View      | Allow the user to confirm booking details and submit |
 
 ### 🎨 Figma Design Exploration
 
 We are using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design our mockups. Below are the identified design properties from the mockup:
 
 #### Color Styles
 - Primary Color: `#FF5A5F` (Airbnb Red)
 - Secondary Color: `#008489` (Dark Teal)
 - Background: `#FFFFFF`
 - Text: `#111111`
 - Disabled Button: `#E6E6E6`
 
 #### Typography
 | Element           | Font Family     | Font Weight | Font Size |
 |--------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
 | Headings           | Inter            | 700 (Bold)   | 24px       |
 | Subheadings        | Inter            | 600 (Semi-bold) | 18px    |
 | Body Text          | Inter            | 400 (Normal) | 16px       |
 | Buttons / Links    | Inter            | 500 (Medium) | 16px       |
 
 > 💡 **Why Identifying Design Properties Matters:**  
 Defining color styles, typography, spacing, and layout early helps maintain consistency across the app and streamlines the development process. It also makes it easier for multiple developers or designers to work together efficiently.

 ## 🧩 UI Component Patterns
 
 To ensure modularity and reusability, we'll break down the UI into common patterns and components.
 
 ### 🔧 Components We Plan to Implement
 
 | Component Name | Description |
 |----------------|-------------|
 | **Navbar**      | Navigation bar with logo, search bar, and user profile |
 | **Property Card** | Displays a thumbnail, title, price, and rating for each listing |
 | **Footer**      | Contains links to About, Privacy, Terms, and Contact pages |
 
 These components will be reused throughout the app and can be customized for different views.
